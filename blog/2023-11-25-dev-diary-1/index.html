  <p>Time travel back to February 2nd, 2022. That was the first major delay I made while I was working on this blog. I created a draft post regarding how to build a discord bot- scratch that, I didn’t even make a tutorial, it’s literally just the metadata and that’s it.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/2023-11-25-dev-diary-1-firstcommits.png" alt="The first few commits done towards the repository" title="The first few commits done towards the repository"></p>
<p>After that, I left the repository alone for more than a year, left it to rot, unlinked, and looking ugly as heck. I did it injustice.</p>
<p>That is until today.</p>
<p>I looked back at my repository list in GitHub again, and hey, at the bottom of it, the <code>blog</code> repo. I had nothing else to do today, so I thought to myself: “Why not breathe life again into this project?”, and so I did.</p>
<h2 id="stage-1-cleanup">Stage 1: Cleanup</h2>
<p>There were some remains of the old setup left that cluttered the repository, so I deleted them all, including the skeleton “make a discord bot” post. I also had a lot of cross-repository resource sharing that really messed with styling on this site, especially after I reworked the main root site before this.</p>
<p>There’s also a teeny-tiny issue that I have, I don’t know anything about Jekyll, or Liquid.</p>
<h2 id="stage-2-learning">Stage 2: Learning</h2>
<p>Markdown was the easy part, Jekyll was as easy as looking at the docs, Liquid, however, was the part that irritated me. Being an avid user of <a href="https://mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a>, I am very accustomed to brackets, brackets everywhere. I thought if I did another thing other than editing wikis, I would have a break from this hell.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<pre class="astro-code github-dark" style="background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="liquid"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#E1E4E8">{% </span><span style="color:#85E89D">raw</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8"> %}</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#9ECBFF">{% for post in site.posts %}</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#9ECBFF">  &#x3C;li class="post-link"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#9ECBFF">  &#x3C;a href="/blog{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}&#x3C;/a> (&#x3C;span class="post-tags">{{ post.tags }}&#x3C;/span>) - &#x3C;span class="post-date">{{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}&#x3C;/span>&#x3C;/li></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#9ECBFF">{% endfor %}</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#E1E4E8">{% </span><span style="color:#85E89D">endraw</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8"> %}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And worst of all, Liquid behaves differently from what I am used to. Fortunately, ChatGPT is here to help, after some extremely basic courses through the chatbot, I was able to create some pretty OK Jekyll and Liquid setup. It was pretty nice.</p>
<h2 id="stage-3-rebuilding">Stage 3: Rebuilding</h2>
<p>Rebuilding everything from scratch. Includes, layouts, templates, assets, everything had to be remade. I started with boilerplating my CSS, created a semantic HTML layout, then the includes like the header and footer.</p>
<p>One of my main gripes is responsiveness, my main site, as of the time of this writing, is NOT responsive, it’s such a shame. And I remade my main site many more times than this one. I realised one of the big things for creating a responsive layout is to let the browser do its scaling, I don’t even need to set up fancy stuff like viewport units, just good design practices (that came from unfruitful experiences).</p>
<p>I also prioritised user experience as to keep myself from getting headaches as well, line heights are expanded, content width is lessened but not to the point of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231102072430/https://visitandorra.com/en/visitor-information/before-you-arrive/passport-visas-customs/">anorexic article</a> (visit the site in a mobile viewport and you’ll see what I mean), and heading sizes are enlargened.</p>
<h2 id="stage-4-republishing">Stage 4: Republishing</h2>
<p>When everything is fine again, it was time to publish my first proper blog post: <a href="https://headquarter8302.github.io/blog/2023-11-16-test">https://headquarter8302.github.io/blog/2023-11-16-test</a>. It was simple but it’s honest work.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It was a fun excercise, and I finally finished my project. Even though I almost left it to die, at least I have a place to write in the future.</p>
